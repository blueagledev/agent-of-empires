///   4. Waiting is detected from approval prompts and numbered `›`/`❯`

  Then it strips ANSI and runs the detector for that agent.
  See src/tmux/session.rs:290 and src/tmux/
  status_detection.rs:38.

  For Codex specifically, active work is detected from:

  - esc to interrupt
  - ctrl+c to interrupt
  - recent status-like lines starting with working, thinking,
    processing, or generating
  - braille spinner characters like ⠋, ⠙, etc.

  That logic is in src/tmux/status_detection.rs:344.

  If those running signals are not present, it then checks
  waiting signals like approvals or numbered choices.
  If none match, it falls back to Idle.

  So this is not OS process-state detection like “is the
  process using CPU.” It is mostly agent UI/state detection
  from hooks or tmux pane text.

› look into possible pain points in our api endpoints here


• I’m going to inspect the API modules and their shared base classes first, then trace any authentication, response, and
  routing patterns that could create recurring pain points. After that I’ll summarize the concrete risks with file references.

  and then I’ll inspect the base class and a few representative endpoints for consistency problems.
